## About us

**Kiso** is a small development group. 

Our new development group draws inspiration from Sony's legacy of using codenames based on Japanese rivers, like the Kumano devices. This reflects our commitment to both innovation, echoing the flow of a river, and building a strong foundation (基礎, Kiso in Japanese) for future projects, just like a new development group would do.

**Stay Tuned:**

This README will be continuously updated as Kiso progresses. We're excited to share our development journey with you!
